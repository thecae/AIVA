# A.I.V.A.

A.I.V.A. (Artificially Intelligent Virtual Assitant) is a virtual assistant created to model and mimic MARVEL superhero Tony Stark's J.A.R.V.I.S. by performing similar functions and computational ability.  A.I.V.A. was born on 05 April 2021 and was first able to input speech and repeat the words said.

A.I.V.A. now has the following integrations (updated 19 July 2021):
- Wikipedia: Allows A.I.V.A. to provide a basic summary of most events, objects, and people
- WolframAlpha: Allows A.I.V.A. to compute a wide range of computations and calculations

Future updates to A.I.V.A. will include the following:
- Interpretation of multiple languages and a basic translation engine
- Certain physics computations and computing threshold values in various scenarios

In an update far, far away, A.I.V.A. will hopefully have a user interface where it can print objects to a screen, display images, graphics, and other items.  This is not dissimilar to the HUD (Heads Up Display) inside the Iron Man Suit.

### Any comments, criticisms, and suggestions are greatly appreciated on this project.  This is my biggest work to date, and I hope to include more integrations and functions soon!
